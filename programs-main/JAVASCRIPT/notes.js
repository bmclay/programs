// variables 
// 1. The name should be unique
// 2. The name should not be any reserved keyword
// 3. The name must start with a Character, _, &.
// var variable = 'variable value';
// //let is the preferred method of creating variables in modern javascript.
// let variableName = 'Welcome to variables'; 
// // you can also assign variables using this syntax using var. const is the method for assigning constants, or variables that never change.
// // reassign the value of the variableName variable
// variableName = 'Hello!'; 

// // you cant re-declare a constant
// const variableName2 = 'Constant variable';
// const variableName2 = 'Constant var 2'; 

// // you cannot declare a const, var or let by the name const, var or let;
// const var = 'variable';
/* variables must be named using the following scheme:
first character needs to be a letter, underscore or a dollar sign.
cannot use special characters within variable names either (only _ and $ is allowed)
*/
