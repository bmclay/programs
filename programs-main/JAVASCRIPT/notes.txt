variables 
1. Variable names should be unique
2. The name should not be any reserved keyword
3. The name must start with a Character, _, &.
var variable = 'variable value';

3 ways to create a variable:
var
let - when you plan on changing the variable later on.
const - constant. cant change the variable.


let is the preferred method of creating variables in modern javascript.
let variableName = 'Welcome to variables'; 

To reassign the variable value:
variableName = 'Hello!'; 

const
const is the method for assigning variables that never change.
You cannot re declare the value of a const with the same name.

You cannot declare a const, var or let by the name const, var or let.

All variables must be named using the following scheme:
first character needs to be a letter, underscore or a dollar sign.
cannot use special characters within variable names either (only _ and $ is allowed)

Comments:
vscode allows you to press ctrl + / to comment out mult lines in vscode. you can highlite a block of code and use this to comment it all out.
// basic single line comment

/* multi
line
comment
*/

Console log
console.log(); 
Watch the console in the developer tools of the browser. If the code is broken you will not see the console, you will see an error.
You can call variables this way, you can put 'strings of text' in the paranthesis.

date    
const date = new Date();
console.log(date)
Data types

strings - typical strings of characters. Feilds of text. Must be surrounded by quotes.
numbers - numbers, includinng onese with decimal values and negative. 
booleans - true or false
null - speccifies we have a place to store a value, but the value doesn't exist
undefined - you dont have a variable or value
object - important data type, the building block for modern javascript. complex data types.
symbol - not so much used

strings
'single' and "double" quotes are not really any different
`backticks` are used to provide extended functionality. 
NaN
not a number. Ofen returned when you try to perform mathmatical operations on strings with numbers.
the data type of NaN is actually number!

booleans
true false normal boolean behaviour for logic. 
true - yes, correct 1
false - no, wrong, 0
booleans are returned as a result of comparison operators.

undefined
javascript considers variables with no data value an undefined data type
simply assigned like:
let x;
notice no value assigned

null
is the datatype of object. a bug in javascript. wont be fixed because if it is, a lot of code out in the world will break.

object
the only variable that can store more than one thing
collection of data
const person = {
    name: 'John'
    age: 25,
}

dot notation
used to get only the specified element of the object specified.
for example to get only the name of the person in the console:
console.log(person.name);

array
ordered data collections
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
when viewing arrays in the console, the index for each element in the array is displayed.

javascript is dynamically typed: it can contain any datatype and be changed to any data type.
some programming languages do not allow variable data to be changed to a different type (statically typed)

comparison operators
>
<
=
>=
<=
== test if both are equal to eachother. loose equality.
!= test if both are not equal to eachother
always return a boolean value

Strict equality
===
Compares both values and types to see if they are the same.
5 is not strictly equal to "5". "5" is a string. 5 is a number.

Strict inequality
!==
check for evyerthing about both variables tro be different
